# The Microchip mcp23x17 GPIO expander -- Now with more Rust

This is a Rust Embedded HAL crate to work with a GPIO expander. I bought this chip just to play with, so don't expect battle hardened code here. Ideally one day it will expose embedded-hal style GPIO pins but that's not a priority.

In fact, nothing here is a priority. Do you feel like making it better? Let me know!
